Application Fact Sheet
-
The application is as basic parent-child and appointment-deadline system. The parent can set appointments for themselves and the whole family. The child can set deadlines for themselves. The way you use the application is by once you enter the home screen you then have to choose whether you are a parent or a child to be taken the respective page. Once you get to either there are many different input forms and fields. To add data to the database you need to enter the correct data into the add function and then click the button to submit it. The view, update or delete data the right side of the page will deal with that. On the parents page you will also have to specify the user ID when inputting the data as you can make appointments for multiple different people. However when you are a child you can only set deadlines for yourself. The buttons work as they would be expected, the delete function requires you to have searched up the data in the first place to then delete, and the same goes for the update button. When you add data you can instantly look up the data you have added by searching whatever the next appointment or deadline ID is.
